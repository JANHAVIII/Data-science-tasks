# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio
## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.
